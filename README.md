This repo holds a few of my virtual analog models of filters and other audio circuits. (It is ongoing **work in progress**.)  

Check out the Jupyter notebooks to see how the models were derived. I am also publishing small write-ups on some of the models on my website every now and then, in case you are interested. â†’ [https://butchwarns.de/](https://butchwarns.de/)
